# Food_Delivery_Website
This is a food delivery web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The platform allows users to browse through a list of restaurants, view available menus, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time. Admins can manage restaurants, update menu items, and process customer orders.
